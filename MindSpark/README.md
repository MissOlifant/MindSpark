# MindSpark Hospital AI Kiosk

## Project Overview

Hospitals heavily rely on human staff to streamline all their workload, like patient registration, managing medical records, and handling inquiries. While this is essential, human input is prone to making human errors, which can range from little inconveniences to life-threatening mistakes.

Introducing this AI system into hospitals can help enhance accuracy, streamline work processes, and reduce the workload burden on hospital staff. This AI-driven solution will aid in patient interactions, medical record management, and administrative tasks, enabling staff to focus on more direct patient care. Automating these procedures and providing efficient, data-driven insights, the system will minimize errors and improve the overall efficacy of hospital operations. It will also reduce the stress on hospital staff as there will be a patient self-service feature with AI assistance to help users.
